Cheesygine

A simple OpenGL C++ application/engine. This project is created with the help of The Cherno's YouTube tutorials. It's a great starting point for learning OpenGL and game engine basics.

Prerequisites

    C++17 or later
    Premake
    OpenGL libraries (GLFW, GLEW)
    A C++ compiler

Premake isn't finished so it doesn't compile on windows yet.
This is just a fun side project with no particular vision. I will try working on it in my free time.
